# Android_Kotlin_Nanodegree_2nd_Project
Asteroid Radar is an app to view the asteroids detected by NASA that pass near Earth, you can view all the detected asteroids given a period of time with data such as the size, velocity, distance to earth and if they are potentially hazardous. In this project, you will apply the skills such as fetching data from the internet, saving data to a database, and display the data in a clear, compelling UI.

What I Used?

RecycleView (display list of asteroids)

Retrofit (download data from internet)

Moshi (convert JSON data to usable class data)

Picasso (download and cache images)

BindingAdapter(implement custom attribute in layout xml)

Room Database (implement offline caching)

Work Manager(schedule to update database every day)

Accessibility (provide basic accessibility such as content description for texts and images)
